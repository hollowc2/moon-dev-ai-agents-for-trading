### Momentum Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Objective**: Capture trends by identifying strong momentum in price movements.
   - **Timeframe**: Use a 15-minute or 1-hour chart for intraday trading.
   - **Asset**: Suitable for liquid assets with high volatility (e.g., major forex pairs, indices, or cryptocurrencies).
   - **Core Principle**: Buy during uptrends and sell during downtrends, focusing on breakouts and pullbacks.

#### 2. **Required Indicators**
   - **Moving Average (MA)**:
     - Use a 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to identify the trend direction.
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
     - Use a 14-period RSI to gauge overbought/oversold conditions.
   - **Average True Range (ATR)**:
     - Use a 14-period ATR to measure volatility and set stop-loss levels.

   - **Long Entry**:
     1. Price must be above the 50 EMA (indicating an uptrend).
     2. RSI must be above 50 (confirming bullish momentum).
     3. Enter on a breakout above a recent swing high or during a pullback to the 50 EMA.
   - **Short Entry**:
     1. Price must be below the 50 EMA (indicating a downtrend).
     2. RSI must be below 50 (confirming bearish momentum).

#### 4. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Set a take-profit level at 1.5x the ATR value from the entry point.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place a stop-loss at 1x the ATR value below the entry point for long trades or above the entry point for short trades.
   - **Trailing Stop**:
     - Use a trailing stop of 0.5x the ATR to lock in profits as the trend continues.

#### 5. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.
   - **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
     - Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:1.5.
   - **Maximum Daily Loss**:
     - Stop trading for the day if losses exceed 5% of the account balance.

#### 6. **Additional Rules**
   - **Avoid Trading During Low Volatility**:
     - Do not enter trades if the ATR value is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 10 pips for forex).
   - **Time Filter**:
     - Only trade during high-volume hours (e.g., London or New York session for forex).

---

#### 7. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Data Range**: Use at least 6 months of historical data.
   - **Slippage**: Assume 1 pip slippage per trade.
   - **Commission**: Include trading fees (e.g., $5 per round trip for futures).
