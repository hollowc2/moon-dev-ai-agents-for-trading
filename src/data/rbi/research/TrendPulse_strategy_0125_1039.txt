STRATEGY_NAME: TrendPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on identifying and trading strong trends using a combination of moving averages, volume analysis, and price action. It is designed to capture sustained directional moves while minimizing false signals.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Trend Identification**: 
   - Use a combination of Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) to identify the trend direction. 
   - Primary EMAs: 50 EMA (short-term trend) and 200 EMA (long-term trend).
   - The trend is considered bullish when the 50 EMA is above the 200 EMA, and bearish when the 50 EMA is below the 200 EMA.

2. **Volume Confirmation**:
   - Use volume as a confirmation tool. A strong trend is confirmed when volume increases in the direction of the trend.
   - Look for higher-than-average volume on breakout or continuation candles.

3. **Price Action**:
   - Use candlestick patterns (e.g., engulfing, pin bars) to identify potential entry points within the trend.
   - Look for pullbacks or retracements to key support/resistance levels or moving averages for low-risk entries.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Bullish Entry**:
   - Wait for the 50 EMA to cross above the 200 EMA, confirming a bullish trend.
   - Look for a pullback to the 50 EMA or a key support level.
   - Enter on a bullish candlestick pattern (e.g., bullish engulfing, hammer) with increasing volume.

2. **Bearish Entry**:
   - Wait for the 50 EMA to cross below the 200 EMA, confirming a bearish trend.
   - Look for a pullback to the 50 EMA or a key resistance level.
   - Enter on a bearish candlestick pattern (e.g., bearish engulfing, shooting star) with increasing volume.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use a trailing stop or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).
   - Exit when the price closes below the 50 EMA (in a bullish trend) or above the 50 EMA (in a bearish trend).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place the stop loss below the recent swing low (for bullish trades) or above the recent swing high (for bearish trades).
   - Alternatively, use a percentage-based stop loss (e.g., 1-2% of the trade value).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Avoid over-concentration in a single asset or sector. Spread risk across multiple instruments.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)**:
   - 50 EMA (short-term trend).
   - 200 EMA (long-term trend).

2. **Volume Indicator**:
   - Use volume bars or a volume moving average to confirm trend strength.

3. **Candlestick Patterns**:
   - Monitor for bullish/bearish reversal patterns at key levels.

This strategy is best suited for trending markets and may underperform in choppy or range-bound conditions. Always backtest and optimize parameters before live trading.
