### Momentum Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Objective**: Capture trends by identifying strong momentum in price movements.
   - **Timeframe**: Use daily or intraday charts (e.g., 1-hour or 4-hour).
   - **Market**: Applicable to stocks, forex, or cryptocurrencies.
   - **Core Principle**: Buy during uptrends, sell during downtrends, and avoid sideways markets.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Indicator Setup**:
     - Use the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** with a period of 14.
     - Use the **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** with a period of 50.
   - **Long Entry**:
     - Price must be above the 50 EMA (confirms uptrend).
     - RSI must cross above 50 (confirms momentum).
     - Enter on the next candle after both conditions are met.
   - **Short Entry**:
     - Price must be below the 50 EMA (confirms downtrend).
     - RSI must cross below 50 (confirms momentum).
     - Enter on the next candle after both conditions are met.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Set a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).
     - Alternatively, exit when RSI crosses back below 70 (for long trades) or above 30 (for short trades).
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place stop loss below the most recent swing low (for long trades) or above the most recent swing high (for short trades).
     - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2% of account equity).

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of account equity per trade.
   - **Diversification**:
     - Avoid over-concentration in a single asset or sector.
   - **Avoid Overtrading**:
     - Only take trades that meet all entry criteria.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
     - Period: 14.
     - Overbought level: 70.
     - Oversold level: 30.
   - **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:
     - Period: 50.

#### 6. **Additional Notes**
   - **Filter for Sideways Markets**:
     - Avoid trading if the price is consolidating (e.g., RSI hovering around 50 and price near the 50 EMA).
   - **Backtesting Parameters**:
     - Test over multiple timeframes and asset classes.
     - Adjust RSI and EMA periods if necessary to optimize for specific markets.
