STRATEGY_NAME: Trend-Breakout Reversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

This is a simple trend-following strategy for cryptocurrency trading that focuses on identifying and trading the breakout of consolidation patterns within a larger market trend. The key components are:

1. Market Structure Analysis:
   - Analyze the market trend across multiple timeframes, starting from the weekly and moving down to the daily and 4-hour charts.
   - Identify the overall market direction (uptrend or downtrend) using higher highs/lows and lower highs/lows.

2. Consolidation Breakout Entry:
   - On the 1-hour timeframe, wait for the market to consolidate in a sideways range.
   - Set an alert to trigger when the 1-hour trend breaks out of the consolidation range, either to the upside or downside.
   - Enter a trade in the direction of the breakout, using the 15-minute timeframe to time the entry.

3. Risk Management:
   - Set a stop-loss just above/below the previous high/low of the 1-hour consolidation range.
   - Use a risk-reward ratio of approximately 1:2 or 1:3, taking partial profits at the first target and trailing the stop-loss on the remaining position.

4. Indicators:
   - This strategy does not rely on any indicators, focusing solely on price action and market structure.

The key advantages of this approach are its simplicity, reliance on the broader market trend, and the use of consolidation breakouts as low-risk entry points. By analyzing the market structure across multiple timeframes and waiting for clear breakout signals, traders can identify high-probability trading opportunities while managing risk effectively.

Remember, this is not financial advice, and as with any trading strategy, proper testing, risk management, and discipline are crucial for long-term success.
