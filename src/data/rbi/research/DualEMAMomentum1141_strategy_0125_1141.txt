STRATEGY_NAME: DualEMA Momentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DualEMA Momentum strategy is a trend-following approach that leverages two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This strategy focuses on capturing fresh trends early and timing entries with precision using volume analysis and price behavior around the EMAs.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Dual EMA Setup**: 
   - Use two EMAs: 
     - **Green EMA (20-period, source: High)**: Tracks the high prices.
     - **Red EMA (20-period, source: Low)**: Tracks the low prices.
   - These EMAs act as dynamic support and resistance levels, helping to identify the strength and direction of the trend.

2. **Trend Selection**:
   - The strategy works best on the 1-hour timeframe.
   - Focus on trends that originate from consolidation phases and respect the 20 EMA lines.
   - Avoid trends that break the 20 EMA lines, as this indicates weakness.

3. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Use volume as a confirmation tool. 
   - Strong trends are accompanied by high volume spikes above the volume moving average.
   - Weak pullbacks are characterized by low volume within the volume moving average.

4. **Entry Signals**:
   - Look for price to break out of consolidation and move aggressively away from the EMAs with strong volume.
   - Wait for a weak pullback to the EMA lines, where volume is subdued.
   - Enter the trade when price shows signs of resuming the trend (e.g., candlestick patterns like bullish/bearish engulfing, pin bars, or support/resistance breaks).

5. **Exit Rules**:
   - Exit the trade if the price breaks the 20 EMA lines, indicating a potential trend reversal.
   - Use a trailing stop or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) to lock in profits.

### Risk Management:
- **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
- **Stop Loss**: Place your stop loss below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
- **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2 to ensure profitability over time.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**:
   - Green EMA: 20-period, source: High.
   - Red EMA: 20-period, source: Low.
2. **Volume Indicator**: Use the default volume indicator to confirm trend strength and pullback weakness.
3. **Volume Moving Average**: Add a moving average to the volume indicator to filter out noise and identify significant volume spikes.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Identify the Trend**:
   - Look for a consolidation phase followed by a breakout.
   - Ensure the price stays above (for uptrends) or below (for downtrends) the 20 EMA lines.

2. **Confirm Trend Strength**:
   - Check for strong volume spikes above the volume moving average during the breakout.
   - Observe the price moving aggressively away from the EMAs.

3. **Wait for Pullback**:
   - Allow the price to retrace to the EMA lines with weak volume (within the volume moving average).
   - Ensure the pullback leg is visually weaker than the swing leg.

4. **Enter the Trade**:
   - Look for candlestick patterns or support/resistance signals near the EMA lines.
   - Enter the trade in the direction of the trend.

5. **Manage the Trade**:
   - Set a stop loss below/above the EMA lines.
   - Use a trailing stop or take profit at a predefined risk-reward level.
