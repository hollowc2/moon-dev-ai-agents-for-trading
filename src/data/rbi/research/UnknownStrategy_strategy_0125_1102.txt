### Momentum Trading Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Objective**: Capture trends by identifying strong momentum in price movements.
   - **Timeframe**: Use daily or intraday charts (e.g., 1-hour or 4-hour).
   - **Market**: Applicable to stocks, forex, or cryptocurrencies.
   - **Core Principle**: Buy when momentum is strong and sell when momentum weakens.

---

#### 2. **Required Indicators**
   - **Moving Average (MA)**:
     - Use a 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) to identify the trend direction.
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
     - Use a 14-period RSI to measure momentum strength.
   - **Average True Range (ATR)**:
     - Use a 14-period ATR to determine volatility and set stop-loss levels.

#### 3. **Entry Rules**
   - **Long Entry**:
     1. Price must be above the 50-period SMA (uptrend).
     2. RSI must be above 50 (momentum is strong).
     3. Wait for a pullback to the 50-period SMA or a key support level.
     4. Enter a long position when price breaks above the recent high (confirmation of momentum continuation).
   - **Short Entry**:
     1. Price must be below the 50-period SMA (downtrend).
     2. RSI must be below 50 (momentum is weak).
     3. Wait for a pullback to the 50-period SMA or a key resistance level.
     4. Enter a short position when price breaks below the recent low (confirmation of momentum continuation).

#### 4. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Set a take-profit level at 2x the ATR value from the entry price.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Set a stop-loss level at 1x the ATR value from the entry price.
   - **Trailing Stop**:
     - Use a trailing stop of 1x ATR to lock in profits as the trend continues.
   - **Exit on RSI Divergence**:
     - Exit the trade if RSI shows divergence (e.g., price makes a higher high, but RSI makes a lower high).

#### 5. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
   - **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
     - Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2.
   - **Maximum Drawdown**:
     - Limit maximum drawdown to 5% of your account balance.

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Data Period**: Test on at least 1-2 years of historical data.
   - **Market Conditions**: Include both trending and ranging markets.
   - **Optimization**:
     - Test different SMA periods (e.g., 20, 50, 100) and RSI thresholds (e.g., 50, 60, 40).
     - Adjust ATR multiplier for stop-loss and take-profit levels (e.g., 1x, 1.5x, 2x).

---

#### 7. **Additional Notes**
   - Avoid trading during low liquidity periods (e.g., weekends, holidays).
   - Use volume confirmation to validate momentum signals.
   - Monitor macroeconomic events that may impact momentum.
