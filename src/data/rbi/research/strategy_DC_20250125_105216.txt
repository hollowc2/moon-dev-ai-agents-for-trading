### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Trend Identification**: Use moving averages to identify the overall market trend.
   - **Momentum Confirmation**: Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to confirm momentum.
   - **Entry Signals**: Look for specific candlestick patterns or price action signals.
   - **Exit Signals**: Use trailing stops or predefined profit targets.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Long Entry**:
     - The 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) must be above the 200-period SMA (uptrend).
     - RSI must be above 50 but below 70 (indicating bullish momentum but not overbought).
     - A bullish candlestick pattern (e.g., bullish engulfing or hammer) must form near the 50-period SMA.
   - **Short Entry**:
     - The 50-period SMA must be below the 200-period SMA (downtrend).
     - RSI must be below 50 but above 30 (indicating bearish momentum but not oversold).
     - A bearish candlestick pattern (e.g., bearish engulfing or shooting star) must form near the 50-period SMA.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Long Exit**:
     - If the price closes below the 50-period SMA.
     - If the RSI crosses below 50.
     - If a trailing stop loss of 2% below the highest price since entry is triggered.
   - **Short Exit**:
     - If the price closes above the 50-period SMA.
     - If the RSI crosses above 50.
     - If a trailing stop loss of 2% above the lowest price since entry is triggered.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1% of the total account balance per trade.
   - **Stop Loss**: Set a stop loss at 2% below the entry price for long trades and 2% above the entry price for short trades.
   - **Take Profit**: Set a take profit at 4% above the entry price for long trades and 4% below the entry price for short trades.
   - **Trailing Stop**: Use a trailing stop of 2% to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.
