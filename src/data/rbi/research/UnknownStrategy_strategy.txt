STRATEGY\_NAME: ATR\_MeanReversion

STRATEGY\_DETAILS:

This strategy focuses on mean reversion using the Keltner channel, an ATR-based stop loss, and a 2B price pattern for entry.

1. Key strategy components:
- Keltner channel with a 20-period setting and a multiplier of 2.5
- ATR-based stop loss
- 2B price pattern for entry

2. Entry/exit rules:
- Enter a short position when price breaks the upper Keltner channel and forms a reversal candlestick.
- Place a sell stop order below the reversal candle.
- Set a protective stop loss just beyond the high of the reversal candle.
- Exit the position if price continues in the trend direction and breaks the high of the reversal candle.

3. Risk management:
- Use an ATR-based stop loss to protect your capital. Calculate the ATR for the same 20-period setting as the Keltner channel and set your stop loss a certain number of ATRs away from the entry price.

4. Required indicators:
- Keltner channel
- ATR (Average True Range)

This strategy aims to trade overextended instruments by identifying mean reversion opportunities using the Keltner channel and a 2B price pattern. It uses an ATR-based stop loss to manage risk and protect capital during trend moves. By combining these tools, traders can potentially profit from mean reversion while minimizing risk.
