STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on identifying and capitalizing on strong momentum moves in the market, using a combination of moving averages, volume analysis, and price action to confirm entries and exits.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Moving Averages**: 
   - Use a 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a 21-period EMA to identify the trend direction.
   - The 9 EMA crossing above the 21 EMA signals a bullish trend, while crossing below signals a bearish trend.
   
2. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Use volume as a confirmation tool. A surge in volume during a breakout or trend continuation increases the validity of the move.
   
3. **Price Action**:
   - Look for breakouts above key resistance levels or below key support levels to confirm momentum.
   - Use candlestick patterns (e.g., bullish/bearish engulfing, pin bars) to confirm entry signals.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Bullish Entry**:
   - The 9 EMA must cross above the 21 EMA.
   - Price must break above a key resistance level with a surge in volume.
   - Enter on the next candle after the breakout, preferably on a pullback to the breakout level or the 9 EMA.

2. **Bearish Entry**:
   - The 9 EMA must cross below the 21 EMA.
   - Price must break below a key support level with a surge in volume.
   - Enter on the next candle after the breakdown, preferably on a pullback to the breakdown level or the 9 EMA.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use a trailing stop based on the 9 EMA. Exit when the price closes below the 9 EMA in a long trade or above the 9 EMA in a short trade.
   - Alternatively, set a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) based on the initial stop-loss distance.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place the stop-loss below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
   - Ensure the stop-loss is outside the noise of the market, typically 1-2 ATR (Average True Range) away from the entry point.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop-loss levels.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Avoid over-concentration in a single asset or sector. Spread risk across multiple instruments.

### Required Indicators:
1. **9 EMA** and **21 EMA**: To identify trend direction and momentum.
2. **Volume Indicator**: To confirm the strength of breakouts or breakdowns.
3. **ATR (Average True Range)**: To set stop-loss levels and measure market volatility.
4. **Support/Resistance Levels**: To identify key price levels for breakouts or breakdowns.

This strategy is designed to capture strong momentum moves while minimizing risk through disciplined entry, exit, and risk management rules.
