STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumLine

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumLine strategy is a sophisticated trend-following approach that combines trendline analysis with momentum confirmation to identify high-probability trade setups. This strategy focuses on two primary patterns: continuation patterns and breakout patterns, both of which are confirmed using additional price action techniques and the Stochastic oscillator.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Trendline Drawing**: 
   - Draw trendlines in the direction of the prevailing trend (below for uptrends, above for downtrends).
   - Adjust the trendline to maximize the number of touches, treating it as a general area rather than an exact line.

2. **Continuation Pattern**:
   - Occurs when price bounces back in the direction of the trend after hitting the trendline.
   - Confirmation is done by drawing a mini trendline at the pullback and waiting for a breakout.
   - Use the Stochastic oscillator to confirm the continuation pattern (oversold for uptrends, overbought for downtrends).

3. **Breakout Pattern**:
   - Occurs when price breaks out of the trendline, indicating a potential trend reversal.
   - Look for signs of momentum loss (e.g., lower highs in an uptrend or higher lows in a downtrend) before the breakout.
   - Additional confirmation can be obtained by spotting double rejections (e.g., double tops or double bottoms).

### Entry Rules:
1. **Continuation Pattern**:
   - Wait for the price to break out of the mini trendline.
   - Confirm with Stochastic crossing back inside the oversold (for uptrends) or overbought (for downtrends) levels.
   - Enter a buy position in an uptrend or a sell position in a downtrend.

2. **Breakout Pattern**:
   - Wait for the price to break out of the trendline.
   - Confirm with signs of momentum loss (e.g., lower highs in an uptrend or higher lows in a downtrend).
   - Enter a sell position in an uptrend or a buy position in a downtrend.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Continuation Pattern**:
   - Exit the trade when the price reaches a significant resistance (for uptrends) or support (for downtrends) level.
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trend continues.

2. **Breakout Pattern**:
   - Exit the trade when the price reaches a significant support (for sell positions) or resistance (for buy positions) level.
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop to capture maximum profit from the new trend.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk a small percentage of your trading capital on each trade (e.g., 1-2%).
   
2. **Stop-Loss Placement**:
   - For continuation patterns, place the stop-loss just below the mini trendline (for buy positions) or above the mini trendline (for sell positions).
   - For breakout patterns, place the stop-loss just above the trendline (for sell positions) or below the trendline (for buy positions).

3. **Risk-Reward Ratio**:
   - Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2 to ensure profitability over the long term.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Trendlines**:
   - Used to identify key levels and potential trade setups.

2. **Stochastic Oscillator**:
   - Used to confirm continuation patterns by identifying overbought or oversold conditions.

3. **Price Action Analysis**:
   - Used to confirm breakout patterns by identifying signs of momentum loss (e.g., lower highs, higher lows, double rejections).

By following the MomentumLine strategy, traders can effectively capitalize on high-probability trend-following opportunities while minimizing risk through careful confirmation and disciplined risk management.
