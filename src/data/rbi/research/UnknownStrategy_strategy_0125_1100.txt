### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Trend Identification**: Use a combination of moving averages to identify the overall market trend.
   - **Momentum Confirmation**: Utilize the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to confirm momentum in the direction of the trend.
   - **Entry Signals**: Look for specific candlestick patterns or price action signals that align with the trend and momentum.
   - **Exit Signals**: Use trailing stops or predefined profit targets to exit trades.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Trend Confirmation**: 
     - Use a 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a 200-period SMA.
     - Enter a long position if the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA (bullish trend).
     - Enter a short position if the 50 SMA is below the 200 SMA (bearish trend).
   - **Momentum Confirmation**:
     - Use a 14-period RSI.
     - For a long position, ensure the RSI is above 50 (bullish momentum).
     - For a short position, ensure the RSI is below 50 (bearish momentum).
   - **Price Action Signal**:
     - Look for a bullish engulfing pattern for long entries.
     - Look for a bearish engulfing pattern for short entries.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
