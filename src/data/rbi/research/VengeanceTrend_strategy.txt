STRATEGY_NAME: VengeanceTrend

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VengeanceTrend strategy is a robust trend-following approach designed to capitalize on strong, sustained market trends while minimizing losses during choppy or sideways markets. This strategy emphasizes trailing stops and disciplined risk management to allow winning trades to run while cutting losses quickly. Below is a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

---

### **Key Strategy Components**
1. **Trend Identification**:  
   - Focus on strong, healthy trends in the market. Avoid trading in choppy or sideways conditions.  
   - Use higher timeframes (e.g., daily charts) to identify the overall trend direction.  
   - Combine technical analysis with fundamental catalysts (e.g., central bank policies, economic events) to confirm the strength of the trend.

2. **Entry Rules**:  
   - Enter trades during pullbacks within the established trend.  
   - Look for price action signals such as breakouts of key resistance levels or bounces off support levels.  
   - Avoid over-optimizing entries; focus on the overall trend rather than pinpoint precision.

3. **Exit Rules**:  
   - Use trailing stops to lock in profits as the trend progresses.  
   - Move stops below key support levels in an uptrend or above key resistance levels in a downtrend.  
   - Exit the trade only when the trailing stop is hit, allowing for maximum profit potential.

4. **Risk Management**:  
   - Use tight stop-losses to limit risk on each trade.  
   - Risk a small percentage of the account (e.g., 1-2%) per trade.  
   - Accept that losing trades are part of the process; aim for a high risk-reward ratio on winning trades to offset losses.

5. **Mindset and Discipline**:  
   - Embrace the psychological challenges of trading, including frequent stop-outs and drawdowns.  
   - Avoid taking profits prematurely; let winning trades run to capture large moves.  
   - Stay patient and disciplined, focusing on the long-term edge of the strategy.

### **Required Indicators**
1. **Price Action**:  
   - Use candlestick patterns and key support/resistance levels to identify entry and exit points.  

2. **Trendlines**:  
   - Draw trendlines to visualize the direction and strength of the trend.  

3. **Trailing Stop**:  
   - Use a trailing stop-loss to protect profits and stay in the trade as long as the trend continues.  

4. **Fundamental Analysis**:  
   - Monitor economic news, central bank announcements, and other catalysts that could drive sustained trends.

### **Step-by-Step Execution**
1. **Identify the Trend**:  
   - Use daily or higher timeframes to determine the overall trend direction (uptrend, downtrend, or sideways).  
   - Confirm the trend with fundamental catalysts.  

2. **Wait for a Pullback**:  
   - Look for a retracement or pullback within the trend.  
   - Avoid entering during overextended moves.  

3. **Enter the Trade**:  
   - Place a buy order above a key resistance level in an uptrend or a sell order below a key support level in a downtrend.  
   - Set a tight stop-loss below the recent swing low (for buys) or above the recent swing high (for sells).  

4. **Manage the Trade**:  
   - As the trade moves in your favor, trail the stop-loss to lock in profits.  
   - Move the stop-loss below new support levels in an uptrend or above new resistance levels in a downtrend.  

5. **Exit the Trade**:  
   - Exit only when the trailing stop is hit.  
   - Avoid taking profits prematurely based on resistance levels or emotional reactions.

### **Risk and Reward**
- **Risk**: Accept a high frequency of small losses (e.g., 57% losing trades).  
- **Reward**: Aim for occasional large wins (e.g., 15:1 risk-reward ratios) to offset losses and generate overall profitability.  

---

### **Psychological Considerations**
- **Patience**: Wait for high-probability setups within strong trends.  
- **Discipline**: Stick to the strategy even during drawdowns or losing streaks.  
- **Emotional Control**: Avoid overtrading or revenge trading after losses.
