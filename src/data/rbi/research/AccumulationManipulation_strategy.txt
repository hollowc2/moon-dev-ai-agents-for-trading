STRATEGY_NAME: AccumulationManipulation

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

1. Key strategy components:
- Accumulation: Price moves sideways or consolidates, indicating resting liquidity above and below these areas.
- Manipulation: Price manipulates in either direction before skyrocketing to the opposite direction.
- Distribution: Price moves in the direction of the market bias after manipulation.

2. Entry/exit rules:
- Identify the market bias using the 1H time frame: higher highs and higher lows for an uptrend, lower highs and lower lows for a downtrend.
- Focus on the 5-minute time frame between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
- Look for accumulation (sideways movement) and manipulation (price moving against the market bias) within the specified time frame.
- Enter a trade when a fair value gap is present after manipulation. Set the stop loss below the low and take profit at the high.
- Improve take profit levels using Fibonacci retracement tool with values set to 1, 0.79, 0.62, 0, -0.62, -1, -1.5, -2, -2.5, and -4. Set take profit at the -2 or -2.5 level, preferably when it aligns with other confluences.

3. Risk management:
- Set a stop loss below the low after entering a trade.
- Use Fibonacci retracement levels to set a more precise take profit level.

4. Required indicators:
- 1H time frame for identifying market bias.
- 5-minute time frame for trade entry.
- Fibonacci retracement tool for improving take profit levels.
