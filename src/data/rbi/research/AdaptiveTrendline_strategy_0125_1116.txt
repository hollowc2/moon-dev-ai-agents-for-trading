STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveTrendline

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The AdaptiveTrendline strategy is a trend-following approach that focuses on identifying and trading breakouts from dynamically adjusted trendlines. This strategy is designed to capture significant price movements by combining trendline analysis with momentum confirmation.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Trendline Analysis: The strategy uses manually drawn trendlines to identify key support and resistance levels. These trendlines are adjusted dynamically based on price action.
2. Momentum Confirmation: The strategy incorporates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to confirm the strength of the trend and avoid false breakouts.
3. Breakout Entry: Trades are initiated when the price breaks through a significant trendline with strong momentum.
4. Risk Management: The strategy employs strict stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage risk and lock in profits.

Entry Rules:
1. Draw a trendline connecting significant swing highs or swing lows.
2. Wait for the price to approach the trendline.
3. Confirm the breakout with a close above (for an uptrend) or below (for a downtrend) the trendline.
4. Ensure the RSI is above 50 (for an uptrend) or below 50 (for a downtrend) to confirm momentum.
5. Enter a long position on a bullish breakout or a short position on a bearish breakout.

Exit Rules:
1. Set a stop-loss just below the breakout point for a long position or above the breakout point for a short position.
2. Set a take-profit level at a predetermined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).
3. Exit the trade if the price retraces and closes back within the trendline, indicating a false breakout.

Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital on any single trade.
2. Use a fixed risk-reward ratio for each trade to ensure consistency.
3. Avoid overtrading by waiting for high-probability setups.

Required Indicators:
1. Trendline Tool: Manually drawn on the price chart to identify key levels.
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI): Set to a 14-period to confirm momentum.

The AdaptiveTrendline strategy is ideal for traders who prefer a visual and dynamic approach to trend following. By combining trendline analysis with momentum confirmation, this strategy aims to capture significant price movements while minimizing false breakouts.
