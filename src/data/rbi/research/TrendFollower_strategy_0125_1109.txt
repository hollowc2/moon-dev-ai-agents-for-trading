STRATEGY_NAME: TrendFollower

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy is a trend-following approach that uses moving averages and price action to identify and trade with the prevailing trend. The key components include:

1. **Key Strategy Components**:
   - **200 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Used to determine the overall trend direction. Price above the 200 EMA indicates an uptrend, while price below indicates a downtrend.
   - **9 EMA**: Used as a dynamic support/resistance level and to identify short-term momentum.
   - **Price Action**: Focuses on candlestick patterns and key levels (support/resistance) for confirmation of entries and exits.

2. **Entry Rules**:
   - **Long Entry**: 
     - Price must be above the 200 EMA (uptrend).
     - Wait for a pullback to the 9 EMA or a key support level.
     - Enter on a bullish candlestick pattern (e.g., engulfing, pin bar) or a break above a recent high.
   - **Short Entry**:
     - Price must be below the 200 EMA (downtrend).
     - Wait for a pullback to the 9 EMA or a key resistance level.
     - Enter on a bearish candlestick pattern (e.g., engulfing, pin bar) or a break below a recent low.

3. **Exit Rules**:
   - **Take Profit**: Use a trailing stop or exit at a predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).
   - **Stop Loss**: Place below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
   - **Trend Reversal**: Exit if the price crosses back below the 200 EMA (for long trades) or above the 200 EMA (for short trades).

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading account per trade.
   - Use proper position sizing based on the distance between entry and stop loss.
   - Avoid overtrading and stick to high-probability setups.

5. **Required Indicators**:
   - 200 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
   - 9 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
   - Candlestick patterns (e.g., engulfing, pin bars)
   - Support and resistance levels

This strategy emphasizes patience, discipline, and trading in the direction of the trend. It works best in trending markets and may underperform in choppy or sideways conditions.
