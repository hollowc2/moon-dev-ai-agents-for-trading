STRATEGY_NAME: Structural Demand Reversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

This strategy focuses on identifying the overall market structure and trading in the direction of the prevailing trend using demand and supply zones. The key components are:

1. Market Structure Analysis:
   - Determine if the market is in an uptrend (higher highs and higher lows) or a downtrend (lower lows and lower highs).
   - Only take trades in the direction of the established trend. Do not try to "fade" or trade against the trend.
   - The market must break the previous valid low/high to confirm a trend reversal.

2. Demand and Supply Zones:
   - In an uptrend, identify areas of demand (consolidation before an impulsive move higher).
   - In a downtrend, identify areas of supply (consolidation before an impulsive move lower).
   - Mark the demand/supply zones using a rectangle tool, covering the low to high of the candle prior to the impulsive move.
   - Only look to enter long trades in demand zones during an uptrend, and short trades in supply zones during a downtrend.

3. Risk Management:
   - Implement a strict risk-to-reward ratio of at least 1:2.5 or higher.
   - Place stop losses just below the demand zone (for longs) or just above the supply zone (for shorts).
   - Set take-profit targets at recent swing highs (for longs) or recent swing lows (for shorts).

Key Requirements:
- Price action analysis to determine market structure and identify valid support/resistance levels.
- Drawing tools to accurately mark demand and supply zones.
- Discipline to only trade in the direction of the established trend and maintain a favorable risk-to-reward ratio.

This strategy aims to capitalize on the market's natural supply and demand dynamics while respecting the overall trend direction. The combination of trend identification, zone recognition, and risk management creates a robust and profitable trading approach.
