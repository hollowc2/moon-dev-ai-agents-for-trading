Below is the complete fixed code with Moon Dev themed debug prints. No strategy logic was changed; only syntax, scoping, and sizing issues (plus indicator/stop level usage) were fixed. Enjoy, and keep on mooning! üåô‚ú®

Moon Dev's Backtest AI üåô
Strategy: AtrReversion
This strategy uses ATR and Keltner Channels to spot overextended markets and then enters mean‚Äêreversion trades following a 2B price pattern.
