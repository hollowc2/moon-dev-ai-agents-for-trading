deep seek ai is 96% cheaper than openai, just as good if not better, and faster. it’s a game-changer for trading automation, especially with their rbi system framework. the cost savings alone are insane.

built an ai agent flow for trading that researches, backtests, and codes strategies. debugging was the bottleneck, but with deep seek’s cost efficiency, it’s now way more accessible. all the code is on github for anyone to use.

automated trading is getting cheaper and faster thanks to deep seek. their ai model is a side project from a quant firm in china, and it’s changing the game. check out the roadmap and github for everything you need to get started.

building out a deep seek model for the rbi agent today. adapting existing code to use deep seek instead of openai. goal is to simplify and document the process clearly. let's get it done.

working on the rbi agent and setting up folders for data and strategies. deep seek integration is the focus, but no assistance feature means we'll use the chat api directly. keeping it simple and efficient.

love coding because you build once and reuse later. today's task: adapt the rbi agent to use deep seek, document the process, and ensure api key handling is solid. let's make it happen.

streamlined the rbii agent by removing assistance-related code and integrating deep seek's chat api directly. simplified the process to focus on research and backtesting trading strategies.

the rbii agent now fetches youtube transcripts, analyzes trading strategies, and runs backtests. it uses indicators like ema and sma to identify trends and momentum for swing trading strategies.

deep seek integration makes the rbii agent more efficient and cost-effective. it researches, codes backtests, and outputs strategies, though some fine-tuning is still needed for accuracy.

open source tools are shaking things up, 96% cheaper than the big players. competition is heating up, and it's exciting to see innovation thrive in this space.

just added a debugging agent to the pipeline. it scans back tests, fixes technical issues, and keeps the strategy intact. clean code, no mess. progress feels good.

debugging phase is live. new folder for clean back tests, deepseek integration for fixing errors, and the ability to debug existing tests. moving fast, making decisions on the fly.

when you say 'n' to debug existing backtests, it runs main and processes new ideas from ideas.txt. it also debugs any new backtests created, saving them in the backtest directory. the flow is clear and efficient.

the focus agent is here to keep me on track, sampling my work and rating my focus out of 10. it's strict, like a drill sergeant, and helps me stay productive as i build agents this year. much love to the process.

deep seek is being used for data processing, and it's pretty neat. pricing is 27 cents per million tokens, with a special discount. open source and efficient, it's a solid choice for handling large datasets.

deep seek is 10x cheaper than other options, making it a no-brainer for anyone looking to save while still getting solid performance. it’s hard not to use it when the savings are that big.

the reasoner is 4-5x cheaper than gbd 40, and it’s working well for backtesting strategies. swing trading instructions and entry rules look solid, but the backtest takes a while to run.

no easter eggs, no emojis, no funny business in the code. these agents are serious, and the focus is on clean, efficient execution. keep it straightforward and effective.

no need for emojis or easter eggs in the work, just keep it clean and focused. you're doing great, much love and keep moving forward. stay locked in and keep building.

machine learning is about testing what works and tossing what doesn't. no fancy equations, just data and results. keep it simple and keep iterating.

success is small efforts repeated daily. stay focused, stay in the gym, and optimize for fun. things move fast, but don't miss the joy in the process.

working on naming conventions for the backtest code outputs. adding dcr for deep seek reasoner and dc for deeps chat to keep things clear. gotta make sure the data is clean and nothing sketchy gets uploaded.

private data folder is hidden to avoid clutter in the ide. not trying to hide anything, just keeping things tidy for ai processing. per token visibility can get messy, so keeping it streamlined.

updating the code to let each ai agent pick its own model. messaging is now more agent-focused. speed is key, so leaning on the chat agent for faster results. gotta keep moving forward every day.

half a trillion dollars is flowing into ai development, and it's wild to see how much it's changing the game. learning to code feels like unlocking a cheat code for the future.

optimizing with ai tools is slow but worth it. using chat for testing is fire, and having multiple models to work with is a solid move. debugging is part of the process, but it’s all coming together.

ai keeps getting cheaper and better, and it’s exciting to see how far it’s come. automating the repetitive stuff is the next step, and it’s crazy to think about where this tech will be in a year.

half a trillion dollars for ai agents? that's wild. if it's true, openai better step on the gas because deepseek is already making moves. this ai battle is heating up every week.

deepseek is at 96% and the competition is fierce. new models dropping every week, getting closer and closer. this is the kind of progress that keeps the ai space exciting. just keep pushing forward.

automating trading with ai agents is the future. if you're curious, check out the roadmap at mv.com. it's all there—discord, github, and the tools to get started. let's keep building and improving.

debugging and pushing through the grind, just like mlk said—can't fly? run. can't run? walk. can't walk? crawl. just keep it pushing. discipline is doing what you hate like you love it. that's the key.

optimizing for fun is the move. added a rotating moon animation to the terminal to gamify the process. it’s the little things that keep the vibe alive and the work enjoyable.

figured out the bug after some panic and persistence. sometimes it’s tedious, but making prompts fire and handling data properly is worth it. gotta keep pushing, even when it feels overwhelming.

updating the rbi agent back test prompt to include data cleaning and fibonacci levels. debugging sessions are paying off, and the prompt keeps improving. let's keep pushing forward.

deep seek r1 is a game-changer—open source, 30x cheaper, and almost as good as 01. running it on consumer hardware feels like playing with alien minds. the ai race is heating up.

running deep seek r1 on two m2 ultras is wild. it's fast, efficient, and opens up new possibilities for ai at home. the competitive environment is driving innovation faster than ever.

deep seek r1 is a free, open-source model that rivals top-tier ai like openai. you can run it on your own computer, and it’s surprisingly fast on m4 macbooks. open-source ai is getting closer to consumer hardware than ever.

bite dance just open-sourced a tool to control your computer with ai. it’s free, lightweight, and takes 2 minutes to set up. open-source ai is moving fast, and it’s exciting to see what’s next.

deep seek r1 shows that restricting access to ai is nearly impossible. you can run a frontier model on a usb stick, and it’s getting faster on consumer hardware. open-source ai is here to stay, and it

focus is key to unlocking your potential, especially when refining code and pushing through the messy parts. no magic pill, just consistent effort and improvement.

deep seek r1 is a new open-source ai model that matches top models like open ai 01 in math, coding, and reasoning. best part? you can run it locally with total privacy and for free.

thrifty cloud hosting can save you big time. upgraded from google cloud to heiter and now running 20 vms across regions for less. sometimes the best tools are the ones you don’t overpay for.

running deep seek r1 locally with oama is straightforward. start with smaller models to test, then scale up if your gpu can handle it. bigger models like 32b and 70b need serious hardware, so take it step by step.

chatbox is a clean, privacy-focused desktop interface for ai models. it’s free, easy to set up, and works with most models. started as a side project, it’s now a powerful tool for running ai locally.

deep seek rag agent lets you run ai reasoning 100% locally using oama. it’s perfect for creating a ratchat bot or offline coding assistant. hardware requirements vary, but local setups are getting cheaper and more accessible.

imagine having everything you ever wanted and capturing that feeling. that's the easiest way to manifest what you want. it's all about the vision and creating your own environment.

building a front end for an rbi agent with fastapi. user inputs links, gets backtest results, and can download strategies. keeping it fun with a rotating moon in the terminal.

just launched the front end and it's working. playing around with fastapi to tweak the wording and make it even better. proud of the progress and grateful for the team.

the front end structure is organized into four main files: main.py for the fastapi backend, index.html for the main webpage, and static files for styling and js. it's all about customization and ease of use.

the ai agents can learn trading strategies from links, create backtests, and show if they're profitable. it's all about making the process interactive and fun for the user while keeping it functional.

real-time terminal output synced with the front end could make the experience more seamless. using websockets or adjusting timers might help bridge the gap between the backend processes and frontend animations.

working on syncing front-end animations with realistic back-end timings. tweaking javascript to match processing times. it's a grind but it's coming together.

building a system where ai agents learn trading strategies from youtube videos, pdfs, or written inputs. they backtest to see if it's profitable. small steps toward big gains.

debugging duplicate messages and refining strategy outputs. front-end needs to show results clearly as they come in. it's messy but progress is progress.

the strategy flows from front to back, then loops through multiple ideas. real-time updates make it interactive and efficient. coding tweaks keep it clean and functional.

we're optimizing the loop for research, backtest, and implementation phases. animations and debug clears ensure a smoother user experience. back to the basics for better results.

enter trading strategies or youtube links for ai analysis and backtesting. the ai builds, debugs, and sends back the code so you can see past performance. keep it simple and effective.

dude, if you're looking to deploy something quick, check out replit. it gives you a public url instantly and makes the whole process way easier than heroku. just rep it and you're good to go.

rest at the end, not in the middle. that's the mindset to keep pushing forward, even when you don't have all the answers. keep building, keep coding, and figure it out as you go. the grind doesn't stop.

head to mav.com for a step-by-step roadmap on trading strategies. the github page has all the code you need, and you can fork it to get your own copy. stay focused on the code, not the chaos. every line brings you closer to your goals.

working on machine learning models means testing predictive features on historical data. if it works, keep it. if not, toss it. no fancy equations, just results.

updating your replit project? pull the latest changes from github using the three dots menu. stay focused, every line of code gets you closer to your goal.

debugging a deployment issue with the rbi agent. trying to figure out if i need the anthropic key or if deep seek is enough. running into some weird errors with fastapi and requirements.txt.

got the web view up but the machine learning flickers when testing strategies. not sure if it's a server issue or something else. gotta eat something real quick before diving back in.

finally got the output running but it's still flickering. thought it would backtest locally like before. gonna grab the latest updates and try again. every problem is a step closer to the solution.

debugging a form submission issue where it's using a get request instead of post. fixing the html form and pushing changes. small efforts add up, stay consistent and keep pushing through the grind.

running into backend errors but logging is helping track them down. the ui looks great locally but not on the hosted version. trying to figure out why subtitles aren't showing up anymore.

considering switching from repet to heroku for hosting. repet costs $25/month and isn't as easy as expected. heroku might be more scalable and cost-effective. decisions, decisions.

pivoting from github to heroku for deployment. deleting all repetitive stuff and setting up a new heroku app. gotta reset the password and verify the account first.

deploying on heroku step by step. setting up environment variables, pushing to main, and running commands. hit a snag with instant outputs but working through it.

successful deployment on heroku but still troubleshooting instant strategy outputs. adding detailed logging and redeploying to figure it out. persistence pays off.

front end's throwing errors but the back end seems to be working fine. logs show progress, but the output files are missing. gotta figure out why it's not syncing up.

running into a weird bug where the front end instantly errors out, but the back end logs look clean. feels like a disconnect somewhere in the flow. time to dig deeper.

back end's doing its thing, but the front end keeps crashing. logs show it's processing, but the output files aren't showing up. gotta keep pushing through and figure this out.

the backend is working but the front end is throwing errors. timeouts are killing me, but we’ll figure it out. gotta keep running it back until it clicks.

spent hours down a rabbit hole trying to fix the front end, but honestly, i’m not a front end dev. time to focus on what matters—building and refining the backend.
