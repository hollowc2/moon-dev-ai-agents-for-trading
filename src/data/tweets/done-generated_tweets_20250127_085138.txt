deep seek is 99% cheaper than openai and just as good, making it the go-to for ai agents in trading. it's fast, efficient, and now the default for most of my agents, though claude and openai remain options.

the focus agent uses deep seek to keep me on track, rating my focus out of 10. if i slack, it nudges me back. the rbi agent is a game-changer, automating backtest strategies by coding them after analyzing videos or papers.

deep seek's biggest flaw? its context window is 25% smaller than openai's, meaning prompts have to be shorter. still, it's a powerhouse for cost-effective ai, especially in trading automation.

grabbing liquidation data and open-high-low-close-volume data from the api. it takes a bit of time but it’s running. all the code is on github, just star and fork to get started with automated trading for free.

deep seek is helping with the liquidation agent and risk agent updates. massive long liquidations detected, up 142%. ai suggests nothing with 50% confidence. still debugging some api response issues.

the bird eye api response structure changed, causing issues with fetching wallet tokens. added more debug prints to diagnose the problem. optimizing to filter out dust tokens and only process meaningful balances.

working on a bot and ran into an issue with the api call. they removed the usd value column, which is crucial for decision-making. now i have to figure out how to get the price for each token manually, which slows everything down. frustrating, but gotta keep pushing.

birdeye changed their api calls and removed the usd value column. now i have to call the price for each token individually, which is going to slow down the bot. not ideal, but trying to find a workaround. stay tuned.

they rugged me with this api change. no usd value means i have to manually fetch prices for each token, which is messy and slows the bot. trying to build a new call to fix it, but

the separation between you and your competitors grows over time. by year five or six, no matter what they do, they can't catch up. that's why i'm here every day—putting in the work. you can't catch me, and i'll keep pushing no matter what.

mlk said if you can't fly, run. if you can't run, walk. if you can't walk, crawl. but you better keep moving. control what you can control—yourself. every day, until we die. that's the mindset.

building on apis can be risky—they can cut you off at any moment. but sometimes you have to for speed. just keep pushing, even when things don’t go

working on integrating deep seek into the discord and updating the code to reflect that. it's a bit tricky but we're making progress. the goal is to have free ai access for everyone.

just added deep seek to the discord and updated the agents to use it. still figuring out how to prove it's actually using deep seek and not falling back to gpt-4. lots of testing and tweaking involved.

just freestyled an email and now debating what to call it. might be too early to send, but hey, worldwide audience means someone’s awake. scheduling it for later today. gotta respect time zones, fam.

spent $7 setting up lambda today. wild. testing new ai in discord now. building something fresh, debugging as i go. gotta stay sharp and keep pushing through the chaos. every line of code brings me closer to mastery.

debugging the rbi agent and tweaking the research prompts. trying to make it more autonomous and efficient. sometimes you gotta front-run the bugs and stay focused. it’s all about the grind and refining the process.

the package agent is live and its job is to ensure the code uses the right indicator packages, not backtesting.lib. it’s all about precision and avoiding trashy stuff. let’s keep swimming.

rbi agent disappeared for a hot second and panic ensued. turns out it was just hiding in plain sight. gotta rewind the game film and stay sharp. back to building greatness.

first try success with ta lib! the debug agent cooked up some heat. time to add more agents for every bug and keep refining the process. stay focused, the code won’t write itself.

working on backtesting strategies with AI agents. debugging and refining the process to ensure each idea gets its own unique strategy. progress is slow but steady, and we're learning as we go.

the AI agents are handling research, backtesting, and debugging for multiple strategies. it's a grind, but discipline is key. doing what you hate like you love it is the secret to success.

spent $22 so far on AI tools for strategy testing. making progress but still ironing out kinks in the code. every line written brings us closer to the goal. stay focused and keep pushing.

learning to code in a second language is no joke. if you’re out here coding in english and it’s not your first language, you’re already ahead of the game. respect.

shoutout to anyone learning spanish or any language while juggling coding. it’s hard, but you’re doing the work. keep going, you’re crushing it.
